### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 âš¡ Fun fact: I have a degree in Mathematics where I concentrated in Abstract Algebras.

I currently maintain/ work on these projects:
* [GitCommander](https://github.com/JamesLoyd/gitcommander)
* [FilterQuery Language](https://github.com/JamesLoyd/FQL) and its [upstream source](https://github.com/atgfr8/FQL)
* [JTheme](https://github.com/JamesLoyd/JTheme) which is my personal color theme for VS Code

You can find JTHeme on the Visual Studio Marketplace [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JamesLoyd.jtheme)
