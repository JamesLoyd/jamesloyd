### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 âš¡ Fun fact: I have a degree in Mathematics where I concentrated in Abstract Algebras.

I currently maintain/ work on these projects:
* [GitCommander](https://github.com/JamesLoyd/gitcommander)
* [FilterQuery Language](https://github.com/JamesLoyd/FQL) and its [upstream source](https://github.com/atgfr8/FQL)
* [JTheme](https://github.com/JamesLoyd/JTheme) which is my personal color theme for VS Code
* [Rimflix-Hockeyflix](https://github.com/JamesLoyd/RImflix-HockeyFlix) is a simple mod for rimflix, which itself is a mod in Rimworld, which adds a cool hockey show to it, so you can watch hockey out on the rim
